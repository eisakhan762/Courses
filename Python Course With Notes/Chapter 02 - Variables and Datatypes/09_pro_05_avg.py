# problem No5 solved -> write a python program to find aveage of two numbers entered by user


# Step 02. first we need to get input from user and store them into a variable/container and typecast it to int because the default type of input is string
# Step 02. then for get average of these two number, the rule to get average is (the sum of all number devided by the how many numbers we have)
a = int(input("Enter first number : "))
b = int(input("Enter second number : "))
avg = (a+b)/2
print("The Average is", avg)
